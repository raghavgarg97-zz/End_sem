The Given Figure represents the execution time for 100 samples for the given number
 of elements for different number of threads.With increase in threads, execution time 
decreases.However this thing is not very much evident with smaller number of elements
as the latency induced in thread creating is not overcome by task time.

\textbf{X is number of elemenets and Y is average Execution time over 100 samples}

 \end{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
The above graph is plotted against log scale of X.We can see that the average execution
time decreases  with increase in number of threads but since my compute had quad core 
processor increasing threads beyond 4 did not help much.

\textbf{X is numner of elements and Y is average time for 1 thread}

\begin{verbatim}
This is just a bar graph reprenation of the average speedups where the average
 is calculated for each thread for different number of samples and then the 
ratio is taken against 1 thread for speedup calculations.Thread 1 has default
 average of 1.

\textbf{X is numner of elements and Y is average time for 1 thread with error bars shown}

 \end{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
Variance is calculated in the avergae speedup of each threads treating average
 time of thread  1 as the golden time against which I calculated my means.More
 error is induced with increasingnumber of threads as the data gets more scattered.
